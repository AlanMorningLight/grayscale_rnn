Train a recurrent network to generate greyscale images using Keras in Python 3.6

One set of weights included, from training over a set of 46 Japanese inkwash (sumi-e) artworks. Training dataset not included.

Easily adapt to train on your own greyscale image set and generate new images. Recommend training on a GPU.
